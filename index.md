### Requirements

  - A stable internet connection.
  - A laptop or desktop computer with an up-to-date browser of your choice. 

### To begin

  - Open a browser and go to `annotate.altumview.com`. This is the website that you will use to do the annotations.
  - You will be given parts that you are to annotate. Use the navigation panel at the top right of the page to go to the parts that you are responsible for.

The UI consists of several parts that each have their own uses. I will break them down below and explain what each part is for.
  1. The top left section of the page indicates whether or not a subject has been annotated. When this is empty, it means that no response has been recorded for the current subject. When you submit, a dialogue box will appear in this section to show you what you have submitted.

  2. The top middle section of the page contains information about the subject that the images are displayed of. Use this information to help decide whether or not a subject has sufficient distinct images.
	  - `Celebrity #`: The index of the subject.
	  - `Celebrity name`: Name of the subject.
	  - `# of pictures`: The total number of pictures that this subject has.
	  - `Ratio of pictures`: Selected images / total number of images.
	  - `Percentage`: The percentage of images that are not selected. Ratio of pictures multiplied by 100.
  3. The top right section of the page contains a navigation panel. You can type in an index number and press the navigate button to tell the page to display the images of the subject at that index number. 

  4. The middle of the page is where all the images are displayed. You can scroll with your cursor inside this section to load more images. The total number of images is shown in the information section. 
 5. For each image, there is a button in the top left corner when you hover over the image. You can press this button to open a new tab in your browser with an enlarged version of the image.
	  - You can click on the image itself to mark or unmark it. This will modify the `ratio of pictures` and `Percentage`  and make the image slightly opaque.
  6. The leftmost and rightmost buttons in the bottom of the page will respectively bring up the subject at one index lower or higher than the current index shown. 
 7. Residing in the bottom middle of the page are the submit buttons. The green `Good` button will annotate the current subject as having sufficient distinct images, and the red `Bad` button will annotate the current subject as the opposite. 

# Objective<a name="Instruction"></a>
  - For each subject, you are to determine whether or not **90% or more of the total number of images belong to a SINGLE face identity**. 
	  - If more than 90% of the images shown for a celebrity subject belongs to a single face identity, then click the green `Good` button.
	  - Otherwise, click the red `Bad` button.
  - You can select an image that you think is not representative of the main identity. Doing this will modify the `Percentage` information. You can use this information to help you in your objective. Images that may satisfy this condition include:
	  - Images with more than 2 people in it.
	  - Images with no faces to identify. 
	  - Images with very poor quality or the subject is too far away.
  - Generally speaking, if you can recognize the main identity in the image then you don't want to mark it.

# Things to keep in mind<a name="Note"></a>
  - Remember the index number so that you can resume your progress using the navigation bar.
  - Make sure to record your time in the time sheet every time you start working.
  - Don't hesitate to reach out to me when you have any concerns.
